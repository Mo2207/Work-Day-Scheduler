# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description:
  
This application is a work-day scheduler that is color-coded based on the current time. Users input can be added to timeblocks and saved to localStorage.
  - My motivation for this project was to learn how to use jQuery and other library's such as dayjs. 
  - I built this application to get better at reading documentation which is heavily required to learn how to use library's.
  - Building this project I learned how much work/code can be saved by using library's. For example I have built my own time format with javascript on my       own, but using dayjs saved me a lot of code/work this time around.
